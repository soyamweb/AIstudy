<p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It encompasses a variety of technologies and approaches, including:
    
    Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI where machines learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Examples include recommendation systems and image recognition.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of machines to understand and respond to human language. This includes applications like chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
    
    Computer Vision: The capability of machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as identifying objects in images or videos.
    
    Robotics: The design and use of robots to perform tasks. Robots can be used in manufacturing, healthcare, and many other fields.
    
    Expert Systems: AI systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert. These systems are used in fields like medical diagnosis and financial forecasting.
    
    Neural Networks: A set of algorithms modeled after the human brain that are designed to recognize patterns. They are used in deep learning, which is a more advanced form of machine learning.
    
    AI can be applied in various industries, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation, improving efficiency, accuracy, and capabilities in numerous fields.
